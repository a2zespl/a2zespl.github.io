_A vision to reality…._

A2ZESPL is all about empowering not so privileged yet determined youth with the most powerful tool –
the right education, to enable them move up in social order and carve out a respected niche for
themselves and their families.

Equality of opportunity as envisaged in our constitution will remain at best a concept if social, economic
and educational disparities in our country are not addressed. Lack of access to basic needs to compete
does not create a level field for many bright and deserving students.

Vision of A2ZESPL is to provide students access to the best education at affordable cost enabling them
to compete with others at equal terms. Since directors at A2ZESPL have been associated with the field of
Medicine for a long period of time, first step in the direction of the desired goal is this platform where
medicine aspirants access all help they need to make a career in Medicine.

With growth in technology, time has come to transform this VISION of the directors into a REALITY.
A2ZESPL aspires to be a companion and friend in a student’s journey a great career in Medicine.
We invite you to be a part of our first humble step in pursuit of realizing our dream. Let us work
together to make India the ‘leader’ of the world again.
